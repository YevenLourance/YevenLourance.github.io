<h1>Reflection</h1>

<p>Before learning the web development, I have a knowlege in HTML components, headings, and paragraph.
However, I am not familiar with CSS and Javascript and how to validate all of my files.

After learning this course, I get a more comprehensive understanding of web components and how to develop 
and design a 
more complicated and interactive website with CSS and Javascript.
I can use the CSS files to describe and change the styles of the designed HTML documents.
I also learnt about how to make a button or a hyper link through HTML interactions.


In the second stage, gallery, to make an interactive gallery, 
I learnt to use javascript in html to help the interactions in the webpage, 
like pop-up windows and sliding window for the image gallery. I learnt to resize image and 
change background colour to make it suitable for my website. 
And it is also useful to learn about image map, as user can 
click different area of the image and it can go to a different page.

Then I learnt how to make a video in iMovie with captions, titles 
and transitions. I learn how to insert it into a html, 
and how to set layout of it. 
What I need to improve is to make video more with more materials and add the interactions 
during the video to engage the users in the video. 

I also learned to link social network content to website with feeds and social network icons. 
The social network buttons are helpful to share the data related to my topic.
Generally, these content are very helpful to my web development skills like the 
beauty and coherence of the whole website and the skills
to design the websites in an artistic way.</p>
