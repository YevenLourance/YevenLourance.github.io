  <div id = "Painting"><b>Painting</b> 
  <p>I drew Chinese painting years ago. Now I normally paint some watercolour in spare time this year. 
  Thus, I am just a beginner of watercolour painting. Here are a 
  collection of my watercolour paintings. I am still on my way in practicing mixing colours and watercolour is 
  really a kind of magic in free play of water.</p>

  <b>Sketching</b>
  
  <p>Simple pencil sketching help me to understand the 3D structure of objects and how we visualise objects 
  in 2D plane. I will practice some portait sketching from time to time to practice my skills to master
  objects structure and cognition. </p>

  <b>Colour Pencil</b>
  
  
  <p>I learn colour pencil sketching by myself. It takes a lot of time to finish one colour pencil drawing, but
  I still think it is the easiest way to express colours in an artistic way. It is similar to normal sketching 
  except we have colours to represent what we observe. </p>
