 <!--  Link to the detailed passion page with images and detailed introduction-->
<p>I am passionate to different aspects of arts. 
I am going to share some arts forms in terms of Watercolour paintings and pencil sketchings with you.
These are the most familiar skills to me currently.</p>


 <!-- briefly list the my hobbies -->

  <ol>
  <li> <a href = "pages/Passion.html#Painting"> Painting </a> 
  <p>I drew Chinese painting years ago. Now I normally paint some watercolour in spare time this year. Here are a 
  collection of my watercolour paintings. I am still on my way in practicing mixing colours.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li> <a href = "pages/Passion.html#Sketching"> Sketching </a> 
  
  <p>Simple pencil sketching help me to understand the 3D structure of objects and how we visualise objects 
  in 2D plane. </p>
  </li>
  
  <li> <a href = "pages/Passion.html#ColourPencil"> Colour Pencil </a> 
  <p>I learn colour pencil sketching by myself. It takes a lot of time to finish one colour pencil drawing, but
  I still think it is the easiest way to draw colours on the paper. </p>
  </li>
